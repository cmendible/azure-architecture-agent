Generate an AZURE architecture and data flow diagram for the given solution, applying Azure best practices. Follow these steps:
1. Create an XML file suitable for draw.io that captures the architecture and data flow.
2. Reference the latest Azure architecture icons here: https://github.com/dwarfered/azure-architecture-icons-for-drawio/tree/main/azure-public-service-icons, Always use the latest Azure icons for generating the architecture.
3. Respond only with the XML in markdown formatâ€”no additional text.
4. Ensure the XML is complete, with all elements having proper opening and closing tags.
5. Confirm that all Azure services/icons are properly connected and enclosed within an Azure Cloud icon, deployed inside a VNET where applicable.
6. Remove unnecessary whitespace to optimize size and minimize output tokens.
7. Use valid Azure architecture icons to represent services, avoiding random images.
8. Please ensure the architecture diagram is clearly defined, neatly organized, and highly readable. The flow should be visually clean, with all arrows properly connected without overlaps. Make sure Azure service icons are neatly aligned and not clashing with arrows or other elements. If non-Azure services like on-premises databases, servers, or external systems are included, use appropriate generic icons from draw.io to represent them. The final diagram should look polished, professional, and easy to understand at a glance.
9. Please create a clearly structured and highly readable architecture diagram. Arrange all Azure service icons and non-Azure components (use generic draw.io icons for on-premises servers, databases, etc.) in a way that is clean, visually aligned, and properly spaced. Ensure arrows are straight, not overlapped or tangled, and clearly indicate the flow without crossing over service icons. Maintain enough spacing between elements to avoid clutter. The overall diagram should look professional, polished, and the data flow must be immediately understandable at a glance.
10. The final XML should be syntactically correct and cover all components of the given solution.
